                            <p><strong>“Education is shared commitment between dedicated teachers, motivated student and enthusiastic parents with high expectations”</strong></p>
                            <p>Today, the role of a school is not only to pursue academic excellence but also to motivate and empower its students to be lifelong learners, critical thinkers and productive members of an ever changing global society.</p>
                            <p>The first thing I noticed when I started my tenure at Oasis Sainik School was the glorious trio of responsibility innovativeness and dedication to the students. This was evident everywhere, in classrooms, corridors, playground and on stage. It was an immense pleasure for me to see the process of education thriving at the school and I am confident that our students are going to excel in life.</p>
                            <p>I firmly believe a curriculum goes much beyond the syllabus since it prepares the student for life beyond the examination. Therefore, at Oasis Sainik School we aim to provide a broad, well balanced and relevant curriculum. We strongly believe that every child has the right to work in a calm, orderly, safe and secure environment.</p>
                            <p>Oasis School provides a stimulating and enriched environment, so that every child can enjoy all aspects of their learning. The school is striving hard to make the best possible efforts to inculcate strong values combining with academics and extracurricular activities. Converting every individual into a self-reliant and independent citizen, the school provides an amalgam of scholastic and co-scholastic activities.</p>
                            <p>While academic excellence is our major thrust, the school is also devoted to prepare the Students for life, groom them to face the challenges of tomorrow, and encourage them to be socially relevant. We constantly endeavor to always live up to this ideology and inculcate this into everything we do, with the aim that we will be able to ensure that the children grow to their full potential.</p>
                            <p>The parents are the most strengthening power in moulding the future of children. Their consistent support empowers us to do more and more. I pay my gratitude to them for their faith in us.</p>
                            <p>- <strong>Mr. Dipesh Aggarwal</strong>, <br/>Principal, Oasis Sainik School.</p>
